SwiftDP: An Efficient Framework for Automated Data Preparation Pipeline Generation


#### Quick Start

1.  Before running the code, please make sure your Python version is 3.8.18. 
2.  pip install autodatapre

#### Run Example

1. demo.ipynb provides two quick examples that correspond to the Demonstration Scenarios in the paper.

2. We support classification and regression tasks.

3. Taking classification as an exampleï¼š

   import autodatapre as SwiftDP

   datasetName = your_dataset_path # e.g. "autodatapre/datasets/42493.csv"

   datasetTarget = the_target_column_name # e.g. 'Delay'

   runTime = 10

   df = pd.read_csv(datasetName, sep = ',', encoding = 'ISO-8859-1')

   detailResult, preparedDataset = SwiftDP.Classifier(df, datasetName, datasetTarget, runTime)

   SwiftDP.EnhancedFunction(df, preparedDataset, detailResult, taskType = "CLA")

4. If runTime is not specified in the Classifier function, run until convergence.

5. Regressor has the same settings.
